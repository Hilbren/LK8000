================================================================================
= Build Target                                                                 =
================================================================================

TARGET=[PPC2002|PPC2003|PNA|PC|PCX64|LINUX|KOBO|PI]

for Linux build, if "install" is added to command lin, LK8000-LINUX and all file 
needed for run software are installed into $HOME/LK8000

================================================================================
= Build Option                                                                 =
================================================================================

All Target :

    DEBUG=[y|n]  
        default = "n"
        if y is specified, no optimzation is made and debug info are include.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LINUX Target :

    OPENGL=[y|n]
       default = "y" if libgl is available
       if "n" is is specified, libSDL with Memory rendering is used.

    USE_EGL=[y|n]
       default = "y" if "libgl" and "libegl" are available

    GLES=[y|n]
       default = "n"

    GLES2=[y|n]
       default = "n"

    USE_SDL=[y|n]
       default = "y" if "libegl" not available or OPENGL=n

    USE_SDL2=[y|n]
        "y" by default if USE_SDL=y or OPENGL=n or USE_EGL=n and libSDL2 are available. 

Do you want LINUX greyscaled like on Kobo? 
$make -j4 TARGET=LINUX OPENGL=n GREYSCALE=y DITHER=y clean
$make -j4 TARGET=LINUX OPENGL=n GREYSCALE=y DITHER=y install
Notice the "clean" will also remove the Distrib folder. That is needed
to rebuild bitmaps for use without opengl


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Raspberry Pi 2
    PI=<rPi rootfs directory>
        required only for cross compile.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Desktop Target ( LINUX or PC ) :

    FULLSCREEN=[y|n]
        default = "n"
